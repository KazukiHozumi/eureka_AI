"21","akutagawa","ahen.txt","僕はこの頃矢野目源一氏の訳した、やはりフアレエルの「静寂の外に」を読み、もう一度この煙に触れることになつた。"
"22","akutagawa","ahen.txt","尤もこの「静寂の外に」は芳しい鴉片の匂の外にも死人の匂をも漂はせてゐる。"

"28","akutagawa","ahen.txt","死人の土地から洩れて来るにしてはあんまり音が大き過ぎる。"

"30","akutagawa","ahen.txt","泥溜の中で棺桶が嚔をする。"
"31","akutagawa","ahen.txt","――一枚の板が揺ぶられる。"
"32","akutagawa","ahen.txt","頑丈な釘がうちつけてあるのを恐しい音をさせて軋ませる。"
"33","akutagawa","ahen.txt","……」"
"34","akutagawa","ahen.txt","これはポオの「Premature Burial」が大西洋の彼岸に伝へた幾多の反響の一つである。"
"35","akutagawa","ahen.txt","が、そんなことはどうでも好い。"
"36","akutagawa","ahen.txt","僕にちよつと面白かつたのは下に引用する一節である。"

"38","akutagawa","ahen.txt","「ところで已に仏蘭西の土地で阿片を造らうとして失敗をつづけ乍らさまざまに苦心した。"
"39","akutagawa","ahen.txt","東京から持つて来た罌粟の種子を死骸で肥えた墓地に植ゑて見ると思ひの外に成績がよくてその特徴を発揮させることが出来た。"

"42","akutagawa","ahen.txt","鴉片に死人を想はせるのはフアレエルの作品に始まつたのではない。"
"43","akutagawa","ahen.txt","僕はこの頃漫然と兪※の「右台仙館筆記」を読んでゐるうちにかう云ふ俗伝は支那人の中にもあつたと云ふことを発見した。"
"44","akutagawa","ahen.txt","それは同書の中に掲げた「賈慎庵」の話に出合つたからである。"

"72","akutagawa","ahen.txt","堂上に一官坐す。"

"81","akutagawa","ahen.txt","官文書を判して一吏に付し、与に同じく出づ。"
"82","akutagawa","ahen.txt","」そこで賈が吏の顔を見ると、これはとうに墓の下へはひつた昔の隣人の周達夫である。"
"83","akutagawa","ahen.txt","賈は進んで周の名を呼んだ。"

"88","akutagawa","ahen.txt","周は驚いてかう言つた。"
"89","akutagawa","ahen.txt","が、賈は更に桶中の物の何であるかを尋ねて見た。"
"90","akutagawa","ahen.txt",""
"91","akutagawa","ahen.txt","「鴉片｜煙膏なり。"
"92","akutagawa","ahen.txt","」"
"93","akutagawa","ahen.txt","鴉片はまだ乾隆の末には今日のやうに流行しなかつた。"
"94","akutagawa","ahen.txt","従つて賈も亦鴉片とは何ものであるかを知らなかつた。"
"95","akutagawa","ahen.txt",""
"96","akutagawa","ahen.txt","「鴉片煙とは何物ぞ？」"
"97","akutagawa","ahen.txt","「方今承平日に久しく、人口過剰に苦しんでゐる。"

"99","akutagawa","ahen.txt","元来大劫なるものは水火刀兵の災に過ぐるものはない。"
"100","akutagawa","ahen.txt","この劫に遇ふものは賢愚｜倶に滅びてしまふ。"
"101","akutagawa","ahen.txt","福善禍淫の説も往往此に至つて窮まるものである。"
"102","akutagawa","ahen.txt","そこで天帝は諸神の会議を召集し、特に鴉片煙劫を創めることにした。"
"103","akutagawa","ahen.txt","鴉片煙劫とは世間の罌粟の花汁を借り、熬錬して膏と成し、人の吸食に任ずるものである。"
"104","akutagawa","ahen.txt","この煙を食ふものは劫中に在り、この煙を食はざるものは劫中に在らず。"
"105","akutagawa","ahen.txt","その人の自ら取るに任かせて造物の不仁を咎めさせないのである。"
"106","akutagawa","ahen.txt","この劫有りて以て人口過剰の数を銷除すれば、則ち水火刀兵の諸劫は十の五六を減ずるであらう。"
"107","akutagawa","ahen.txt","けれどもこの罌粟と云ふものは草花に属するものであり、古来世間には多いものである。"
"108","akutagawa","ahen.txt","その又汁も淡薄であるから、熬して膏とすることは出来ない。"
"109","akutagawa","ahen.txt","故に九幽の主に命じ、無間地獄中に不忠不孝無礼義破廉恥諸罪の魂を選び取つてこの間に録送し、膏血を搾取して地上山陵原隰墳衍の神に転付し、この膏血をして罌粟の花根内に灌ぎ入らしめ、根よりして上は花苞に達せしむれば、則ちその汁も自然に濃郁にして、一たび熬錬を経れば、光色黝然たらん。"
"110","akutagawa","ahen.txt","子試みに之を識れ。"
"111","akutagawa","ahen.txt","数十年の後、この煙天下に遍からん。"

"118","akutagawa","ahen.txt","」賈は悸いて目を醒ました。"
"119","akutagawa","ahen.txt","それからこの夢を人に語つた。"
"120","akutagawa","ahen.txt","けれども誰一人信ずるものはない。"
"121","akutagawa","ahen.txt","そのうちに道光の中葉頃に至り、鴉片煙は果して流行し出した。"
"122","akutagawa","ahen.txt","尤も賈はそれよりも前に故人の数にはひつてゐる。"
"123","akutagawa","ahen.txt","しかし賈の夢の話は未だに人の耳に残つてゐる。"
"124","akutagawa","ahen.txt","そこでその頃誰からともなしに「鴉片煙中死人の膏血有り」などと口々に言ひ囃すやうになつた。"
"125","akutagawa","ahen.txt","……"
"126","akutagawa","ahen.txt","墓地に植ゑた罌粟の花から絶好の鴉片が得られると云ふのはフアレエルの想像の生んだものであらうか？それとも又上に掲げた支那の俗伝の生んだものであらうか？僕は勿論どちらとも断言する資格を持つてゐない。"
"127","akutagawa","ahen.txt","唯この俗伝を生じたのも或は虞美人の血の化して虞美人草となつた話に根ざしてゐるかと思ふだけである。"
"128","akutagawa","ahen.txt",""
"129","akutagawa","ahen.txt","なほ最後につけ加へたいのは鴉片の煙は煙草のそれよりも、――殊に紙巻や葉巻のそれよりも東洋的香気の強いことである。"
"130","akutagawa","ahen.txt","若し鴉片の煙の匂に近い匂を求めるとすれば、それは人気のない墓地の隅に寺男か何かの掃き集めた樒の葉を焚いてゐる匂であらう。"
"131","akutagawa","ahen.txt","従つて鴉片の煙の匂は清朝の支那人は暫く問はず、僕等現代の日本人にも墓、――死人、――死などと云ふ聯想を伴ひ易いものである。"
"132","akutagawa","ahen.txt","が、それ等の聯想は必しもあの「悪の華」の色彩を帯びてゐるとは限つてゐない。"
